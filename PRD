Cloud‑Themed Website Front‑End – Action Plan and Product Requirements Document
Project overview

The client wants a modern, responsive front‑end website whose visual identity is inspired by the uploaded photograph of a clear sky with cumulus clouds. The site should feel open, calm and optimistic, reflecting the bright blue sky and soft clouds in the reference image. Blue is a particularly versatile colour for web design: bright, sky‑like hues evoke friendliness and peace, whereas darker shades convey expertise and authority

Goals and objectives

Convey trust and calmness: Use a blue‑and‑white palette inspired by the sky. Bright blues should evoke optimism while darker blues ground the design and convey professionalism

.

Ensure accessibility and performance: Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines for contrast and keyboard navigation. Optimise images and code to achieve quick load times and good Core Web Vitals.

Target audience

Primary audience: Prospective customers or users seeking information about the product/service offered by the company. They may range from casual visitors to business professionals.

Secondary audience: Potential partners or investors evaluating the brand’s professionalism and trustworthiness.

Design & aesthetic requirements

Colour palette:

Primary colours:

Sky blue (e.g., #87CEEB or the “Morning Sky” tone) to echo the lightness and optimism of the photograph
hookagency.com
.

Deep cerulean (#00303F) to provide contrast for headings and navigation
hookagency.com
.

White (#FFFFFF) for backgrounds and whitespace to maintain clarity
whitepeakdigital.com
.

Accent colours:

Honey yellow (#DCAE1D) for buttons or highlights; used sparingly to draw attention without overpowering the blue
hookagency.com
.

Mist green (#7A9D96) for subtle hover states or secondary elements
hookagency.com
.
These colours should be tested for sufficient contrast and adjusted to meet accessibility standards.

Typography: Use large, expressive sans‑serif typography for headings and concise body text. Expressive typography is a modern trend that can act as a focal point while maintaining readability
dev.to
. Ensure font weights and sizes scale appropriately across devices.

Imagery and backgrounds: The hero section should feature a stylised sky background derived from the reference image. Additional custom illustrations (e.g., subtle cloud icons) can add personality without cluttering the interface.

Layout: Employ an asymmetric grid to add visual interest while maintaining structure
dev.to
. Generous margins and padding should create breathing room. Use full‑width sections separated by white space and subtle colour blocks to segment content logically.

Micro‑interactions: Incorporate subtle hover effects on buttons and interactive elements, parallax scrolling for background images, and smooth transitions when navigating between sections. Micro‑interactions and animations should guide users without overwhelming them

.

Dark mode (optional): Provide a toggle allowing users to switch to a darker palette. The dark mode should rethink colour balance and accessibility rather than simply inverting colours
dev.to
.

Functional requirements

Landing/hero section: Includes a logo, navigation menu, headline, supporting text and a clear call‑to‑action (CTA). The background should be an image or gradient reminiscent of the sky, optimised for fast loading.

About section: Summarises the company or product, using cards or blocks with icons/illustrations and concise copy. White space should separate each block
whitepeakdigital.com
.

Features/services section: Present key offerings with interactive visuals, icons or illustrations. Use micro‑interactions (e.g., hover reveals more information)
whitepeakdigital.com
.

Testimonials or case studies: Optional slider or grid showing user stories or client logos. Use the mist green or honey yellow accent colours for highlights.

Contact or sign‑up section: Include a form with fields for name, email and message/requirements. Provide a CTA button using the accent colour. Consider adding a chatbot to answer common questions; AI chatbots can enhance user engagement and handle multiple interactions simultaneously
whitepeakdigital.com
.

Footer: Contains navigation links, social media icons and copyright information. Maintain consistent colour usage and spacing.

Accessibility: All interactive elements must be keyboard navigable with appropriate ARIA labels. Text should have sufficient contrast against backgrounds, as required by WCAG 2.1.

Technical requirements

Framework: Use a modern JavaScript framework such as React with Next.js for server‑side rendering and improved performance. Consider using TypeScript for type safety.

Styling: Apply Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules to manage styles efficiently while allowing customisation of colour palette and spacing. Tailwind’s utility classes simplify responsive design and support dark‑mode variants.

Responsive design: Implement mobile‑first styling. Use CSS flexbox and grid for layout, ensuring content adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, including ultrawide and foldable displays

.

Images: Optimise background and illustration assets (compress images, provide WebP formats). Use lazy loading for non‑critical images to reduce initial load times.

Performance: Optimise for Core Web Vitals—minimise JavaScript bundle size, defer non‑critical scripts, and enable caching. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve assets globally.

SEO: Ensure semantic HTML structure (e.g., <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>), descriptive metadata and alt text for images.

Analytics and metrics: Integrate an analytics tool (e.g., Google Analytics) to track page views, bounce rate, time on page and conversion rates.

Accessibility gaps: Mitigation: perform accessibility audits early and iteratively; involve assistive technology users in testing.

Browser compatibility problems: Mitigation: test on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) and use polyfills as needed.

Action plan for using Codex

Prepare development environment: Once the user logs into Codex, set up the Git repository and Next.js project according to the technical requirements. Include ESLint and Prettier for code quality.

Implement design system: Define Tailwind CSS configuration with the chosen colour palette (sky blue, cerulean, honey yellow and mist). Create reusable components such as buttons, cards and navigation bars following the design guidelines.

Build layout and pages: Use Codex to generate code for the hero section, about section, features, testimonials and contact form. Ensure each component is responsive, accessible and follows the spacing guidelines. Use parallax and micro‑interactions where appropriate.

Integrate assets: Incorporate optimised images of the sky and clouds, along with any custom illustrations. Use semantic HTML and alt attributes for accessibility.

Testing and refinement: With Codex, iterate on the codebase by running unit tests, fixing bugs and optimising performance. Leverage Codex suggestions to resolve issues and improve code quality.

Deployment: Use Codex to set up continuous deployment (e.g., via Vercel or Netlify). Monitor analytics and gather feedback after launch, then iterate on design and functionality as needed.

By following this action plan and the requirements above, the development team can create a modern, visually compelling website that reflects the calmness and professionalism associated with blue tones
